The 2025-26 UEFA Champions League semi-final draw has been completed, and European football now knows the four matchups that will determine who travels to the Allianz Arena in Munich on May 30 to contest the final. Four clubs remain. Two ties. And every single one of them has a legitimate case to win Europe's biggest prize this season.

This is the moment the entire season has been building toward. The group stages, the knockouts, the quarter-finals — all of it has been a filter to reach this point. What we have left is not a predictable semifinal lineup. It is four genuinely different teams with four genuinely different styles, each representing a different tactical philosophy and a different argument for what modern elite football looks like.

Here is everything you need to know — the full fixtures, the dates, the detailed analysis of every matchup, the key players to watch, and our prediction for who wins the Champions League 2026.

## Bayern Munich vs PSG: The Tactical Breakdown

This is the tie that everyone in European football wanted to see. Bayern Munich have been the most complete team in the competition this season — dominant in possession, relentless in the press, and devastating on the counter. Under their manager, they have averaged 2.8 goals per Champions League game, a figure that leads the entire competition. They have conceded just seven times in twelve European appearances.

PSG have transformed completely since the departure of their previous superstar generation and the arrival of a deeply integrated team unit. Their midfield three is the best in France by some distance and arguably one of the best in Europe. They press with intelligence, retain possession with confidence, and have learned how to win ugly when the occasion demands it.

> "This PSG team is fundamentally different from the one we have seen in previous seasons. They play for each other now. That makes them significantly more dangerous in a two-legged tie."
> — UEFA Technical Observer Report, February 2026

The key battleground will be Bayern's high defensive line against PSG's rapid transition play. In the quarter-finals, PSG repeatedly found space in behind defensive lines that pushed too high — three of their last four Champions League goals came in behind the opposition's last defender. Bayern's backline, despite being world-class, is vulnerable to exactly that kind of movement.

However, Bayern at the Allianz Arena in a European semi-final is one of the most forbidding environments in world football. PSG have historically struggled in Germany — losing all three of their previous competitive away matches in Munich.

### Key Players — Bayern Munich

| Player | Position | UCL Stats |
|---|---|---|
| Harry Kane | Striker | 12 goals |
| Jamal Musiala | Attacking Midfield | 8 goals · 9 assists |
| Manuel Neuer | Goalkeeper | 6 clean sheets |

### Key Players — PSG

| Player | Position | UCL Stats |
|---|---|---|
| Warren Zaïre-Emery | Central Midfield | 7 goals · 11 assists |
| Bradley Barcola | Left Wing | 10 goals this season |
| Gianluigi Donnarumma | Goalkeeper | 8 clean sheets |

## Arsenal vs Atletico Madrid: The Clash Nobody Expected

This is the most fascinating matchup of the semi-finals and the one that is hardest to predict. Arsenal are in their first Champions League semi-final since 2009. The emotional weight of that alone will be felt at the Emirates when they host the first leg. But emotion alone has never won a European tie, and Arsenal know that better than most.

What makes Arsenal dangerous is their pressing system — which under Mikel Arteta has become one of the best-drilled high-pressure systems in world football. They regain possession faster than any other team in the competition this season, and their transitions from defence to attack are clinical. Bukayo Saka and Martin Ødegaard have combined for 23 direct goal contributions in the Champions League this season alone.

Atletico Madrid are built to destroy exactly what Arsenal want to do. Diego Simeone's system — deep defensive blocks, disciplined shape, lethal set pieces, and ruthless counter-attacks — is specifically designed to absorb pressure and punish teams that commit numbers forward. It has beaten better teams than Arsenal in knockout football before. It will be Arteta's biggest tactical test of his entire managerial career.

The critical factor is Arsenal's away form. At the Emirates, they are virtually unbeatable — they have not lost a European home knockout tie in Arteta's era. Away from home in high-pressure European nights, the picture is more complicated. They conceded two goals at Dortmund in the quarter-final second leg before eventually progressing. Atletico at the Civitas Metropolitano, in front of one of the most hostile atmospheres in football, is a considerably harder test than that.

### Why This Tie Will Be Decided at Set Pieces

Both teams rank in the top four in the Champions League for set-piece goals this season. Arsenal score them, Atletico both score and concede them strategically. This tie will almost certainly be decided by a set piece — a corner, a free kick, or a penalty. That is not a criticism of either team's open-play quality. It is simply what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object.

Arsenal's set-piece delivery has been a weapon throughout this campaign. Atletico's set-piece defending, however, is militaristic in its organisation. Watch this specific battle within the battle — it will tell you who goes to the final before the 90 minutes are even up.
