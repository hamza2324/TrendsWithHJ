Rockstar Games has finally given us enough to work with. Between the two official trailers, the updated GTA 6 website, and the most dedicated fan-mapping project in gaming history, we now have a near-complete picture of what the Grand Theft Auto VI map actually looks like  and it is bigger than almost anyone expected.

Fan analysts using coordinate tracking across both trailers have estimated the GTA 6 map at approximately **125 km (around 60 square miles)**  making it roughly **2.5 to 2.7 times the size of GTA 5's Los Santos**. One detailed Reddit calculation put the figure at exactly 2.16x, while the dedicated GTA6 Mapping community project settled on 2.7x after the second trailer dropped in May 2025.

Either way, the conclusion is the same: this is Rockstar's biggest open world ever built, and it is not particularly close.

**GTA 6 releases November 19, 2026** on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick confirmed in February 2026 that the release date is locked and marketing will intensify through the summer. No PC release date has been confirmed  based on Rockstar's history with GTA 5 and Red Dead Redemption 2, PC is expected 12 to 18 months after console launch.

Here is everything confirmed about the map, every location, every feature, and what it all means for the most anticipated game release in history.

## GTA 6 Map Size: How Big Is It Really?

The honest answer is that Rockstar has not officially released a numbered map size. What they have done is:

- Released two full trailers packed with explorable visual data
- Published an official website with confirmed location names and descriptions
- Allowed the GTA6 Mapping community project  built by fans analysing every frame of footage  to reconstruct approximately 90% of the map

The result of all of that: **~125 km estimated total map area**, spanning a fictional version of Florida called **the state of Leonida**.

For comparison:

| Game | Estimated Map Size |
|---|---|
| GTA 5 (Los Santos) | ~49 km |
| Red Dead Redemption 2 | ~75 km |
| **GTA 6 (Leonida)** | **~125 km (estimated)** |
| Minecraft (one world) | ~4,096 km (procedural) |

GTA 6's map is not just bigger than GTA 5  it is bigger than Red Dead Redemption 2, which was previously Rockstar's largest handcrafted world. The draw distance confirmed in Trailer 2 supports these numbers  fans noted that distant cars, traffic signs and lamp poles remain rendered at full detail, something no previous GTA game has come close to achieving.

> "The draw distance is INSANE. Usually, far away models are reduced to low polygon and no shadows, but here we can see fairly detailed objects, like cars, traffic signs and lamp poles."

## Every Confirmed GTA 6 Location  All Six Regions

Rockstar confirmed six distinct named locations on the official GTA VI website. These are not just neighbourhoods  they are full biome regions, each with their own visual identity, ecosystem and gameplay character.

### 1. Vice City 
The centrepiece of the map. Vice City is Rockstar's fictional version of Miami  neon-lit, dense, coastal, and chaotic. The original Vice City game (2002) covered a relatively compact area. This version is exponentially larger, with a fully modelled downtown skyline, beach strips, suburban sprawl, and a metro system. Expect the highest NPC density, the most enterable buildings, and the most mission activity to be concentrated here.

Vice City was last in the GTA universe in 2002's *Grand Theft Auto: Vice City* when Tommy Vercetti ran the city. This version is set in the modern day  the contrast will be extraordinary.

### 2. Leonida Keys 
A string of islands based on the real Florida Keys  one of the most visually distinct areas confirmed in the trailers. Expect waterways, bridges, small island communities, boating gameplay, and a very different pace to Vice City. The Keys also hint at significant water-based gameplay that GTA 5 largely left underdeveloped.

Some fans have theorised about a Fort Jefferson-inspired location in the outer Keys, though this remains unconfirmed by Rockstar.

### 3. Grassrivers 
Rockstar's version of the Florida Everglades. This is the swampland, the wilderness, the hunting and off-road territory. Fans who loved the rural areas of Red Dead Redemption 2 will find this region familiar in tone. Expect alligators, remote communities, dirt roads and a gameplay atmosphere entirely unlike Vice City.

The Grassrivers region is where the game's rural criminal storyline elements  debt collection, local shakedowns  appear to be most concentrated based on early trailer context.

### 4. Port Gellhorn 
A port and harbour district. Based on trailer footage, Port Gellhorn appears to be a working industrial coastal area with shipping infrastructure, docks, and the kind of gritty environment that suits heist setups and smuggling storylines. It sits between the urban character of Vice City and the natural character of Grassrivers.

### 5. Ambrosia 
A suburban and small-town area. Less is confirmed about Ambrosia than the other regions, but the name and visual context from trailer footage suggests a quieter, more residential zone  possibly where some of Jason and Lucia's early story takes place based on the debt-collection narrative.

### 6. Mount Kalaga National Park 
Mountains and national park terrain  a dramatic visual contrast to the flat coastal areas dominating the rest of Leonida. Mount Kalaga suggests significant elevation changes, hiking trails or wilderness exploration, and a visual palette completely unlike anything seen in previous GTA titles.

A possible **second state called Gloriana**  based on Georgia  has also appeared in rumours and some data analysis, which would make the world even larger. Rockstar has not confirmed this.

## GTA 6's Two Protagonists: Jason and Lucia

GTA 6 marks the **first time in franchise history that a female character is a playable lead protagonist.** The two characters are:

**Jason Duval**  Ex-military, likely with a paratrooper background based on a shoulder tattoo visible in trailer footage. Hard, capable, and embedded in the criminal world of Leonida.

**Lucia Caminos**  Originally from Liberty City (GTA's version of New York). Her father taught her fighting skills. She is seen wearing an ankle monitor early in the story  she removes it quickly and it does not affect gameplay. Her arc is the more emotionally complex of the two.

The narrative is described as inspired by **Bonnie and Clyde**  a romantically-involved criminal duo caught in a conspiracy larger than themselves, forced to rely on each other to survive.

The character selection wheel offers three modes: Solo Jason, Solo Lucia, and simultaneous dual-protagonist control in open world. This is a significant evolution from GTA 5's Michael/Trevor/Franklin system, which only allowed one active character at a time.

## 700+ Enterable Locations: What We Know

Rockstar has confirmed  and fan analysis of trailers has supported  that GTA 6 will feature over **700 fully enterable buildings and interactive locations**, including:

- Nightclubs with working interiors
- Motels and hotels
- Restaurants and fast food joints
- Pawn shops
- Gun stores
- Fully explorable malls
- Skyscrapers
- The **Vice City Metro Station** (a transit system  first in a GTA game)
- Gyms, tennis courts, basketball courts
- Fishing and hunting locations (returning from RDR2)

For comparison, GTA 5 had approximately 30-40 genuinely enterable unique interiors. The jump to 700+ is extraordinary and represents Rockstar's most ambitious interior design effort in any game they have ever made.

## GTA 6 Graphics: What Rockstar Confirmed

The visual technology in GTA 6 is a significant step beyond anything in the current generation:

- **Ray Traced Global Illumination**  realistic lighting that bounces dynamically
- **Ray Traced Reflections**  accurate surface reflections in real time
- **Volumetric cloud systems** comparable to Red Dead Redemption 2
- **Dynamic sweat system** on character models (confirmed, matches RDR2 level of detail)
- **Parallax Mapping** simulating realistic building interiors even from outside
- **Working wristwatches** on playable characters showing real in-game time
- **Beer bottles** and similar objects with fully modelled fluid physics
- **Extremely far draw distances** with full-quality distant object rendering

The NPC system has also been confirmed as the most advanced Rockstar has built  pedestrians react differently to players depending on location, time of day, what the player is doing, and the NPC's own background context.

Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick addressed the delay directly in early February 2026, saying he is "confident" the November date holds and that marketing will "kick into overdrive in the summer." Former Rockstar developer Obbe Vermeij dismissed delay rumours as "clout chasing."

GTA 5 has sold over **190 million copies worldwide** since 2013. Take-Two has hinted at "record-level financial expectations" for GTA 6's launch year. It is widely expected to become the fastest-selling entertainment product in history.

## Why GTA 6 Will Be the Biggest Game Launch Ever

The numbers support the claim. GTA 5 generated **$800 million in its first 24 hours** in 2013  the fastest entertainment product to that milestone at the time. Adjusted for the growth in gaming, streaming, and social media since then, GTA 6's opening week could realistically exceed **$2 billion**.

The cultural weight of this release cannot be overstated. GTA 5 has been continuously updated and played for **13 years**. The audience that grew up with GTA 5 is now between 20 and 35 years old  with disposable income, social media reach, and deep emotional investment in this franchise. When GTA 6 drops in November 2026, it will dominate the internet in a way that very few entertainment products ever have.
