<!-- ARTICLE BODY -->
<article class="article-body"><p>The FIFA World Cup 2026 group stage draw took place on 
<strong>December 5, 2025</strong> at the John F. Kennedy Center for 
the Performing Arts in Washington D.C. — and for the 
first time in history, 48 teams now know exactly who 
they face in the biggest sporting tournament on earth.</p>
<p>The ceremony was hosted by Heidi Klum and Kevin Hart, 
with Tom Brady, Wayne Gretzky, Aaron Judge and Shaquille 
O'Neal assisting in the draw. US President Donald Trump, 
Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and Canadian Prime 
Minister Mark Carney were also present. Lionel Scaloni, 
Argentina's World Cup-winning manager, carried the 
trophy onto the stage.</p>
<p>The result? Twelve groups, 48 nations, 104 matches, and 
one winner on <strong>July 19, 2026 at MetLife Stadium, New 
Jersey</strong>. Here is every group, every fixture, and 
everything you need to know.</p>

<h2>The Complete FIFA World Cup 2026 Group Stage Draw</h2>
<h3>Group A</h3>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Team</th>
<th>FIFA Ranking</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td>🇲🇽 Mexico (Host)</td>
<td>15</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>🇰🇷 South Korea</td>
<td>22</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>🇿🇦 South Africa</td>
<td>—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>UEFA Playoff D Winner*</td>
<td>—</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>*UEFA Playoff D: Denmark, Czechia, Republic of 
Ireland, North Macedonia — decided March 2026</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Mexico have the advantage as hosts and 
should top this group. South Korea are dangerous and 
have the quality to make the knockouts. The Playoff D 
winner — likely Denmark — could make this genuinely 
competitive.</p>
<p><strong>Opening match:</strong> Mexico vs South Africa — 
<strong>June 11, 2026, Estadio Azteca, Mexico City</strong> 
(Tournament opener)</p>
<hr>
<h3>Group B</h3>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Team</th>
<th>FIFA Ranking</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td>🇨🇦 Canada (Host)</td>
<td>—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>🇨🇭 Switzerland</td>
<td>17</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>🇶🇦 Qatar</td>
<td>—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>UEFA Playoff A Winner*</td>
<td>—</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>*UEFA Playoff A: Italy, Wales, Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
Northern Ireland — decided March 2026</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Switzerland are actually the 
highest-ranked confirmed team in this group. Canada 
as hosts get massive crowd support. If Italy qualify 
through the playoff, this group becomes far more 
competitive overnight. Qatar are unlikely to threaten.</p>
<p><strong>Opening match:</strong> Canada vs UEFA Playoff A Winner — 
<strong>June 12, BMO Field, Toronto</strong></p>
<hr>
<h3>Group C</h3>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Team</th>
<th>FIFA Ranking</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td>🇧🇷 Brazil</td>
<td>5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>🇲🇦 Morocco</td>
<td>—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>🏴 Scotland</td>
<td>—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>🇭🇹 Haiti</td>
<td>—</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Brazil vs Morocco is one of the most 
anticipated group stage matches of the entire 
tournament. Morocco reached the semi-finals in 2022 
and are not an easy team for anyone. Brazil should 
advance but this is not the walk it looks on paper.</p>
<p><strong>Must-watch match:</strong> Brazil vs Morocco</p>
<hr>
<h3>Group D — USA's Path</h3>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Team</th>
<th>FIFA Ranking</th>

<tbody><tr>
<td>🇺🇸 USA (Host)</td>

<tr>
<td>🇵🇾 Paraguay</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>🇦🇺 Australia</td>
<td>26</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>UEFA Playoff C Winner*</td>
<td>—</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>*UEFA Playoff C: Türkiye, Romania, Slovakia, Kosovo</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> USA got a manageable draw as hosts. 
Paraguay and Australia are beatable. The wildcard is 
the Playoff C winner — if Türkiye qualify (ranked 25) 
they immediately become the second-highest ranked team 
in the group and a serious threat. USA opens against 
Paraguay on June 12 at SoFi Stadium, Los Angeles.</p>
<p><strong>Opening match:</strong> USA vs Paraguay — 
<strong>June 12, SoFi Stadium, Inglewood, California</strong></p>
<hr>
<h3>Group E</h3>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>

</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td>🇩🇪 Germany</td>
<td>9</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>🇪🇨 Ecuador</td>
<td>—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>🇨🇮 Ivory Coast</td>
<td>—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>🇨🇼 Curaçao</td>
<td>82</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Germany got the easiest draw of any 
top-ranked nation. Curaçao, ranked 82nd, made 
history as the smallest nation by population 
(156,115 people) ever to qualify for a World Cup. 
Germany should cruise through this group and will 
be rested and confident heading into the knockouts.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Group F</h3>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Team</th>
<th>FIFA Ranking</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td>🇳🇱 Netherlands</td>
<td>7</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>🇯🇵 Japan</td>

<tr>
<td>🇹🇳 Tunisia</td>
<td>—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>UEFA Playoff B Winner*</td>
<td>—</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>*UEFA Playoff B: Poland, Ukraine, and others</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Netherlands are favourites but Japan are 
genuinely dangerous — they knocked Germany out in 
Qatar 2022. This group has the closest FIFA ranking 
gap between all four teams of any group, making it 
potentially the most competitive in the tournament.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Group G</h3>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Team</th>
<th>FIFA Ranking</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td>🇧🇪 Belgium</td>
<td>8</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>🇮🇷 Iran</td>
<td>—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>🇪🇬 Egypt</td>
<td>—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>🇳🇿 New Zealand</td>
<td>—</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Belgium's Golden Generation has aged 
but still has quality. They should advance 
comfortably alongside Iran, who are the only other 
team in the group ranked in the top 50. 
Belgium-Egypt on the opening match day is a fixture 
worth watching.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Group H</h3>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Team</th>
<th>FIFA Ranking</th>

</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td>🇪🇸 Spain</td>
<td>1 (World No.1)</td>

<tr>
<td>🇺🇾 Uruguay</td>
<td>16</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>🇸🇦 Saudi Arabia</td>
<td>60</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>🇨🇻 Cape Verde</td>
<td>68</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Spain, ranked World No.1 and tournament 
favourites at +400 with bookmakers, got a testing 
draw with Uruguay at 16th in the world. But Saudi 
Arabia (60th) and Cape Verde (68th) make this a 
managable group overall. Spain will top it — the 
question is whether Uruguay take second.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Group I — The Group of Death 💀</h3>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Team</th>
<th>FIFA Ranking</th>

<tbody><tr>
<td>🇫🇷 France</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>🇸🇳 Senegal</td>
<td>—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>🇳🇴 Norway</td>
<td>—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Intercontinental Playoff 2</td>
<td>—</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> This is <strong>the Group of Death</strong> at 
FIFA 2026. France (Mbappé), Norway (Haaland), 
Senegal (Mané, Mendy) — three nations with genuine 
world-class talent in a single group. France and 
Senegal's opener is loaded with history: they met 
at the 2002 World Cup where Senegal pulled off one 
of the greatest upsets in tournament history, 
beating France 1-0. Norway are in their first 
World Cup since 1998 and Haaland will be 
absolutely desperate to perform on the biggest stage.</p>
<p>Don't be surprised if all three teams finish level 
on points and the third-place team still advances.</p>
<p><strong>Must-watch match:</strong> France vs Senegal · 
France vs Norway (Mbappé vs Haaland)</p>
<hr>
<h3>Group J</h3>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>

<tbody><tr>
<td>🇦🇷 Argentina</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>🇦🇹 Austria</td>
<td>—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>🇩🇿 Algeria</td>
<td>—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>🇯🇴 Jordan</td>
<td>—</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Argentina, with or without Messi, 
should win this group comfortably. At +800 with 
bookmakers, the defending champions are among the 
favourites to retain their title. Austria and 
Algeria will fight for second place — only 11 FIFA 
ranking spots separate them.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Group K</h3>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Team</th>
<th>FIFA Ranking</th>

</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td>🇵🇹 Portugal</td>
<td>6</td>

<tr>
<td>🇨🇴 Colombia</td>
<td>13</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>🇺🇿 Uzbekistan</td>
<td>50</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Intercontinental Playoff 1*</td>
<td>—</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>*Playoff 1: DR Congo, Jamaica, New Caledonia</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Portugal vs Colombia is appointment 
television. Both are expected to advance — the 
opening match between them will likely decide who 
tops the group. Ronaldo vs the new generation of 
Colombian talent. Uzbekistan, at 50th, are the 
first Central Asian nation in recent World Cup 
history and represent a fascinating story.</p>
<p><strong>Must-watch match:</strong> Portugal vs Colombia 
(Ronaldo's potential last group stage match)</p>
<hr>
<h3>Group L</h3>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Team</th>
<th>FIFA Ranking</th>

</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td>🏴 England</td>
<td>4</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>🇭🇷 Croatia</td>
<td>10</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>🇵🇦 Panama</td>
<td>—</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>🇬🇭 Ghana</td>
<td>—</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Based on FIFA rankings, Group L has 
the strongest case for being the toughest group in 
the tournament after Group I. It is the only group 
with two top-10 ranked teams — England (4th) and 
Croatia (10th). England are +600 with bookmakers 
to win the whole tournament. Croatia have the 
experience. Panama and Ghana make this a full 
group of four genuine footballing nations.</p>
<p><strong>Must-watch match:</strong> England vs Croatia 
(rematch of Euro 2020 group stage)</p>
<hr>
<h2>The Group of Death — Group I Breakdown</h2>
<p>Group I is unanimously being called the most brutal 
group in the tournament. Let's be specific about 
why:</p>
<p>France are ranked 3rd in the world and are the 
second favourites at +650 to win the whole 
tournament. Kylian Mbappé is in peak form. Their 
squad depth is extraordinary — even without 
Benzema, they have six or seven players who would 
walk into any other international squad.</p>
<p>Norway are making their first World Cup appearance 
since 1998. Erling Haaland has been the most 
dominant striker in club football for three years 
running. He has never played a World Cup match. 
His motivation is absolute.</p>
<p>Senegal won the Africa Cup of Nations in 2022 
and are the strongest African nation at this 
tournament. Sadio Mané, Edouard Mendy, Kalidou 
Koulibaly — this is a squad with genuine 
world-class quality across every position.</p>
<p>Three of these teams could finish with identical 
points. Two go through. One of these genuine 
heavyweights goes home in the group stage.</p>

<p>Spain are the bookmakers' favourite — ranked World 
No.1 and coming off their Euro 2024 triumph, they 
are the most complete international squad in the 
world right now. England at +600 reflect the belief 
that this is finally their generation's moment.</p>
<hr>
<h2>The 5 Most Anticipated Group Stage Matches</h2>
<p><strong>1. Brazil vs Morocco (Group C)</strong>
The 2022 semi-finalists against the five-time 
World Champions. This is a genuine blockbuster.</p>
<p><strong>2. France vs Senegal (Group I)</strong>
History between these two nations. Senegal beat 
France in 2002. Mbappé vs Mané. The emotion in 
this match will be extraordinary.</p>
<p><strong>3. France vs Norway (Group I)</strong>
Mbappé vs Haaland. Two of the greatest players 
on earth in a direct group stage confrontation. This is the game every neutral wants to see.</p>
<p><strong>4. Portugal vs Colombia (Group K)</strong>
Ronaldo's likely final group stage match. Colombia 
are the highest-ranked team Portugal face. Whoever 
wins this tops the group.</p>
<p><strong>5. England vs Croatia (Group L)</strong>
A Euro 2020 rematch with massive stakes. Two 
top-10 nations fighting for first place.</p>
<hr>
<h2>The 6 Teams Still to Qualify</h2>
<p>Six spots remain open, to be decided in <strong>March 
2026</strong> through playoffs:</p>
<p><strong>UEFA Playoffs (4 spots):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Playoff A: Italy, Wales, Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
Northern Ireland → Group B</li>
<li>Playoff B: Poland, Ukraine + others → Group F</li>
<li>Playoff C: Türkiye, Romania, Slovakia, Kosovo 
→ Group D</li>
<li>Playoff D: Denmark, Czechia, Ireland, 
North Macedonia → Group A</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Intercontinental Playoffs (2 spots):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Playoff 1: DR Congo, Jamaica, New Caledonia 
→ Group K</li>
<li>Playoff 2: Iraq, Bolivia, Suriname → Group I</li>
</ul>
<p>The biggest name here is Italy — if they win 
Playoff A, they enter Group B with Canada and 
Switzerland and immediately become a major story. 
Italy missing a World Cup (as they did in 2018 
and 2022) would be a massive footballing news 
event. Their qualification is not guaranteed.</p>
<p>Türkiye in Playoff C is also significant — 
if they qualify, they go into Group D with the 
USA and become the second highest-ranked team 
in that group.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>The FIFA World Cup 2026 group stage draw has 
delivered everything football fans wanted. A clear 
Group of Death. A fairytale story with Curaçao. 
A potential Ronaldo farewell in Group K. Mbappé 
vs Haaland in Group I. Argentina defending their 
title. England finally looking like genuine 
contenders.</p>
<p>The tournament kicks off on <strong>June 11, 2026</strong> 
in Mexico City. The final is on <strong>July 19 at 
MetLife Stadium, New Jersey</strong>. Between those 
two dates, 48 nations will play 104 matches 
across 16 venues in three countries.</p>
