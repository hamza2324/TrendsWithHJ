<article class="article-body"><p>The 2025-26 UEFA Champions League semi-final draw has been completed, and European football now knows the four matchups that will determine who travels to the Allianz Arena in Munich on May 30 to contest the final. Four clubs remain. Two ties. And every single one of them has a legitimate case to win Europe's biggest prize this season.</p>
<p>This is the moment the entire season has been building toward. The group stages, the knockouts, the quarter-finals  all of it has been a filter to reach this point. What we have left is not a predictable semifinal lineup. It is four genuinely different teams with four genuinely different styles, each representing a different tactical philosophy and a different argument for what modern elite football looks like.</p>
<p>Here is everything you need to know  the full fixtures, the dates, the detailed analysis of every matchup, the key players to watch, and our prediction for who wins the Champions League 2026.</p>
<hr>
<h2>The Full Champions League Semi-Final Draw 2026</h2>
<p>UEFA conducted the draw on February 27, 2026 in Nyon, Switzerland. There are no seedings at this stage  every team can be drawn against any other. The home-and-away legs take place across April and early May.</p>
<h3>Semi-Final Tie 1  Bayern Munich vs Paris Saint-Germain</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>First Leg:</strong> April 29, 2026  Allianz Arena, Munich</li>
<li><strong>Second Leg:</strong> May 6, 2026  Parc des Princes, Paris</li>
<li><strong>Head-to-Head:</strong> Bayern lead 8W4D3L in all European ties</li>
<li><strong>Last Meeting:</strong> UCL Quarter-Final 2021  Bayern won 3-2 on aggregate</li>
</ul>
<h3>Semi-Final Tie 2  Arsenal vs Atletico Madrid</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>First Leg:</strong> April 30, 2026  Emirates Stadium, London</li>
<li><strong>Second Leg:</strong> May 7, 2026  Civitas Metropolitano, Madrid</li>
<li><strong>Head-to-Head:</strong> First ever meeting in European competition</li>
<li><strong>Combined UCL Goals This Season:</strong> Arsenal 72  Atletico 61</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Bayern Munich vs PSG: The Tactical Breakdown</h2>
<p>This is the tie that everyone in European football wanted to see. Bayern Munich have been the most complete team in the competition this season  dominant in possession, relentless in the press, and devastating on the counter. Under their manager, they have averaged 2.8 goals per Champions League game, a figure that leads the entire competition. They have conceded just seven times in twelve European appearances.</p>
<p>PSG have transformed completely since the departure of their previous superstar generation and the arrival of a deeply integrated team unit. Their midfield three is the best in France by some distance and arguably one of the best in Europe. They press with intelligence, retain possession with confidence, and have learned how to win ugly when the occasion demands it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This PSG team is fundamentally different from the one we have seen in previous seasons. They play for each other now. That makes them significantly more dangerous in a two-legged tie."
 UEFA Technical Observer Report, February 2026</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The key battleground will be Bayern's high defensive line against PSG's rapid transition play. In the quarter-finals, PSG repeatedly found space in behind defensive lines that pushed too high  three of their last four Champions League goals came in behind the opposition's last defender. Bayern's backline, despite being world-class, is vulnerable to exactly that kind of movement.</p>
<p>However, Bayern at the Allianz Arena in a European semi-final is one of the most forbidding environments in world football. PSG have historically struggled in Germany  losing all three of their previous competitive away matches in Munich.</p>

<h2>Arsenal vs Atletico Madrid: The Clash Nobody Expected</h2>
<p>This is the most fascinating matchup of the semi-finals and the one that is hardest to predict. Arsenal are in their first Champions League semi-final since 2009. The emotional weight of that alone will be felt at the Emirates when they host the first leg. But emotion alone has never won a European tie, and Arsenal know that better than most.</p>
<p>What makes Arsenal dangerous is their pressing system  which under Mikel Arteta has become one of the best-drilled high-pressure systems in world football. They regain possession faster than any other team in the competition this season, and their transitions from defence to attack are clinical. Bukayo Saka and Martin degaard have combined for 23 direct goal contributions in the Champions League this season alone.</p>
<p>Atletico Madrid are built to destroy exactly what Arsenal want to do. Diego Simeone's system  deep defensive blocks, disciplined shape, lethal set pieces, and ruthless counter-attacks  is specifically designed to absorb pressure and punish teams that commit numbers forward. It has beaten better teams than Arsenal in knockout football before. It will be Arteta's biggest tactical test of his entire managerial career.</p>
<p>The critical factor is Arsenal's away form. At the Emirates, they are virtually unbeatable  they have not lost a European home knockout tie in Arteta's era. Away from home in high-pressure European nights, the picture is more complicated. They conceded two goals at Dortmund in the quarter-final second leg before eventually progressing. Atletico at the Civitas Metropolitano, in front of one of the most hostile atmospheres in football, is a considerably harder test than that.</p>
<h3>Why This Tie Will Be Decided at Set Pieces</h3>
<p>Both teams rank in the top four in the Champions League for set-piece goals this season. Arsenal score them, Atletico both score and concede them strategically. This tie will almost certainly be decided by a set piece  a corner, a free kick, or a penalty. That is not a criticism of either team's open-play quality. It is simply what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object.</p>
<p>Arsenal's set-piece delivery has been a weapon throughout this campaign. Atletico's set-piece defending, however, is militaristic in its organisation. Watch this specific battle within the battle  it will tell you who goes to the final before the 90 minutes are even up.</p>

<h2>Who Wins the Champions League 2026? Our Prediction</h2>
<p>We have watched every Champions League match this season. We have tracked the form, the injuries, the tactical evolution of each team, and the specific matchup conditions created by this draw.</p>
<p><strong>Our prediction: Arsenal win the 2026 UEFA Champions League.</strong></p>
<p>This is Mikel Arteta's year. Arsenal have the best pressing system in the competition, the most cohesive squad unit, and crucially  the momentum and belief of a team that knows it is on the right side of history. They will beat Atletico Madrid on away goals after a tight two-legged tie. In the final, they meet Bayern Munich  who eliminate PSG in a classic  and win in extra time after a tense 1-1 draw at 90 minutes. Bukayo Saka scores the winner. Arsenal lift their first Champions League trophy in their history.</p>
<p>This prediction is made on form, data and the specific conditions created by this draw  but football never guarantees anything, and that is exactly why we watch.</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>This Champions League semi-final draw has given European football the two ties it deserved. Bayern vs PSG is the glamour clash, the heavyweight collision, the match that casual fans will tune in for. Arsenal vs Atletico is the tactical chess match, the test of two philosophies, the tie that genuine football people will study and debate for years regardless of who goes through.</p>
<p>What we know for certain is this: on May 30 in Munich, European football will have a new champion. And whoever it is will have earned it through four of the hardest possible knockout ties the draw could have produced. That is what makes the Champions League the greatest club competition on earth  the journey to the trophy always proves the worthiness of the winner.</p>
